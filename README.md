# Smart-Baby-Monitor-App-with--KivyMD
A real-life monitoring app to observe baby's vitals and to communicate with the baby.
This project is a KivyMD-based baby monitoring application that interfaces with a Raspberry Pi to monitor and display environmental data such as temperature and movement. The app is designed to help parents keep track of their baby's well-being by providing real-time updates on these parameters.

##Features
* Real-time Monitoring: Receives and displays live data from a Raspberry Pi, including temperature and movement.
* Responsive UI: Built with KivyMD, providing a modern and responsive user interface that works on multiple platforms.
* Audio Alerts: Integrates audio alerts to notify parents when certain thresholds are crossed (e.g., movement detected or temperature changes).
* Modular Design: Easy to extend with additional sensors or features.


This folderÂ contains the necessary documents to create a mobile app for observing an infant's vitals. The app consists of 5 screens to allows us to observe the baby's vitals and  



real-time temperature, sleep/awake and moving/stable conditions, if the baby is crying the app will send notifications to the parent in the app and in the 4th screen of the app namely "Talking/Crying" screen this will be written.
